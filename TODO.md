19. ✅ Added typed API service methods for timeline, analytics, and compliance endpoints
20. ✅ Added React Error Boundary component wrapping the entire app
21. ✅ Added 404 Not Found page with navigation options + catch-all route
22. ✅ Improved `useAlerts` hook with proper cleanup, error handling, and `useCallback`
23. ✅ Added ARIA attributes for accessibility across dashboard components

## CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED ⚠️

**You must rotate the exposed AWS credentials immediately:**

- IAM User: `medimind-deploy`
- The access key that was previously committed has been revoked and must be rotated

Steps:

1. Go to AWS IAM Console and select Users then `medimind-deploy`
2. Delete any previously exposed access keys
3. Create a new access key
4. Update any systems using these credentials
5. Consider deleting and recreating the IAM user entirely

## Next Milestones / To Do 🎯

### Priority 1: Merge Feature Branch to Main

- [ ] Open Pull Request: `feature/comprehensive-quality-improvements` → `main`
- [ ] Ensure CI passes (backend tests, ruff lint, frontend lint, security scan)
- [ ] Merge PR after review

### Priority 2: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Run full backend pytest suite locally (`pytest tests/ -v`)
- [ ] Run frontend build and type-check (`npm run build`, `tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Run security scanner (`python docs/security/security_scan.py`)

### Priority 3: Infrastructure Hardening

- [ ] Add Terraform state locking (DynamoDB + S3 backend)
- [ ] Enable CloudFront access logging
- [ ] Add AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring
- [ ] Set up AWS GuardDuty for threat detection

### Priority 4: Documentation

- [ ] Update `docs/api/api-reference.md` with new Pydantic schemas
- [ ] Add API request/response examples to docs
- [ ] Document the new middleware (request ID, error handler)

### Priority 5: Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] Add structured JSON logging to CloudWatch
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms for error rates and latency
- [ ] Add X-Ray tracing for distributed requests

### Priority 6: Mobile Parity

- [ ] Add Error Boundary equivalent in mobile app
- [ ] Add TypeScript types to mobile API service
- [ ] Add mobile-specific analytics events
